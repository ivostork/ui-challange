/*
  RELATIVE UNITS
*/

/* 
- Spacing and font sizes should be relative to the font size which is set by browser (16px usually)
- Which means that you should use relative unit for 99% cases with some exceptions - (1px border)
- There is one small exception - media queries shuld be used with em - some browsers have issues with rem in media queries (Safari)
- Let's say width is set in px and user will increase the font size - the text will not fit into the container
- It would be dangerous to set padding in em because em is always relative to the font size feature

 * CONVERTOR - when using em(breakpoints),rem (almost everything else) everything changes proportionally when user will modify browser font size
